## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Although this is a project that mainly we can develop in HTML and CSS, I developed it in React as a unique component and the CSS for the styles. The most important part was how manage several images in the body using the CSS properties "background-image", "background-repeat","background-size" and "background-position". Also, it was very useful to understand Flexbox to organize the different components of the User Interface and the use of media queries to switch between desktop and mobile versions.

### Continued development

I would like to continue developing this challenges using React as main resource and complementing with other ones as HTML5, CSS, SAAS, among others
